# <img src="img/logo2.png" alt="ProdusicAI Logo" width="50"> ProdusicAI - Music Production AI Assistant

An intelligent chat interface for music production assistance, powered by Azure OpenAI and LangChain. The application uses a combination of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and specialized AI agents to provide contextual advice about music production techniques.

The RAG system draws from a CSV file containing music production techniques that I have collected over the years from listening to other songs. Where possible they contain a reference song. The Youtube API is used to fetch a video for the suggested song.

The app can either pull a random idea from a given category from the RAG system, or it can be used interactively to ask questions. General questions will also pull any relevant ideas from the RAG system.

## Features

- üéµ Specialized AI agents for different aspects of music production:
  - Composer: Arrangement and music theory
  - Mixing Engineer: Audio processing and mixing
  - Sound Designer: Sound synthesis and design
  - Lyricist: Songwriting and lyrics
  - Project Manager: Overall production guidance

- üìö RAG-powered knowledge base with real music production techniques
- üé• Automatic YouTube example suggestions
- üìù Interactive chat interface with suggested prompts
- üîç Debug logging panel

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Azure OpenAI API access
- YouTube API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zilch42/ProdusicAI.git
cd ProdusicAI
```

2. Install dependencies and setup environment:
This a project is set up to use `uv`. See here to install it if you don't have it already:
[https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
```
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_here
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=your_version_here
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
```

The App is currently configured to use Azure OpenAI. You can change this by editing the `llm` variable in `src/agent_framework.py`

4. Run the application:
```bash
uv run ui.py
```

The interface will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

## Project Structure

- `ui.py`: Main application interface using NiceGUI
- `.env`: Environment variables
- `ideas.csv`: Contains sample data of music production techniques for the RAG system. Required columns are: `Category`, `Technique`, `Description`, `Example`, `Song`, `Timestamp`, `Link`.
- `src/agent_framework.py`: Specialized AI agents implementation
- `src/rag.py`: RAG system for retrieving music production knowledge
- `src/logger.py`: Logging system for debugging

## Usage

1. Open the web interface
2. Choose from suggested prompts or enter your own question
3. The system will:
   - Select the appropriate specialist
   - Retrieve relevant techniques from the knowledge base
   - Generate a detailed response
   - Optionally provide YouTube examples

## Dependencies

Key dependencies include:
- LangChain for AI orchestration
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- NiceGUI for the web interface
- Azure OpenAI for language models
- YouTube API for example retrieval

For a complete list of dependencies, see `pyproject.toml`.
